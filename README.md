# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# E-Commerce Frontend
This repository contains the frontend code for an e-commerce website. The project is built with React, Tailwind CSS, and integrates with a MongoDB backend to display products dynamically. The website is designed to be responsive and provides users with an intuitive shopping experience.
### Project Overview
The e-commerce frontend allows users to:
* Browse through a wide range of shoes.
* View detailed product descriptions and images.
* Select sizes and add products to the cart.
* Experience interactive UI elements, such as image hover effects.
* Seamlessly interact with a backend server to fetch and display data.

### Features
* Dynamic Product Display: Fetches products from a MongoDB backend API and displays them with real-time data.
* Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views using Tailwind CSS.
* Interactive UI: Includes hover effects to switch images, a size selection feature, and an 'Add to Cart' functionality.
* Backend Integration: Communicates with a backend server for data retrieval and updates.

### Tech Stack
* React.
*Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
* MongoDB: A NoSQL database used in the backend to store product details.
* JWT: JSON Web Token for user authentication.
* Vercel: Hosting and deployment of the frontend application.
